# Full Stack Development Task

Welcome to the Full Stack Development Task! üöÄ In this task, you'll be building a Signin/Signup system with JWT authentication, integrating with Redis and either DynamoDB or MongoDB on the backend. Let's get started with the workflow:

## Step 1: Signin/Signup System with JWT, Redis, and DynamoDB/MongoDB

### Backend Setup
- We'll begin by setting up a powerful Node.js server using Express.js.
- For secure authentication, we'll utilize Passport.js.
- JWT tokens will be created and validated using the jsonwebtoken library.
- Redis will be used to store JWT metadata for efficient management.
- User credentials will be securely stored in either DynamoDB or MongoDB.

### Routes
1. **/signup**: Register a new user.
2. **/signin**: Login a registered user.
3. **/auth/google**: Implement Google OAuth for easy authentication.
4. **/auth/github**: Integrate GitHub OAuth for seamless login.

## Step 2: User Type Selection

### Frontend
- After successful signup/signin, users will be presented with the following options: Developer, Organization, Company.

### Backend
- The selected user type will be stored in DynamoDB or MongoDB for future reference.

## Step 3: Hosting Option Selection

### Frontend
- Users will be able to choose from two hosting options: Self Hosting or XeroCode Hosting.
- If Self Hosting is selected, further options will include AWS and GitHub.

### Backend
- The chosen hosting option will be stored in DynamoDB or MongoDB.

## Step 4: GitHub App Integration

### Frontend
- If the user opts for GitHub hosting, they will be redirected to install the GitHub App.

### Backend
- GitHub Apps API will be integrated to facilitate the installation process.
- Once the app is successfully installed, the backend will fetch the user's public and private repositories.

## Display Repositories
- The frontend will present a list of repositories fetched from GitHub.
- This list will empower users to conveniently select repositories for further actions.

**Important Note**: Just like how Netlify requires GitHub access to deploy repositories, your application will fetch repositories, read content, and empower users with deployment options.

With this workflow, you'll create a comprehensive Full Stack application that covers authentication, user preferences, hosting options, and GitHub integration. Happy coding! üöÄüë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª
